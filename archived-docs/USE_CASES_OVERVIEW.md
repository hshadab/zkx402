# ZKx402 Use Cases Overview

**Two complementary ZK services for the x402 ecosystem**

## 🎯 The Complete Trust Stack

### **Use Case #1: ZK-Fair-Pricing** (✅ Built)
**Seller Accountability** - Prove prices are correct

### **Use Case #2: ZK-Agent-Authorization** (📋 Designed)
**Buyer Accountability** - Prove agents are authorized

## 📊 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | ZK-Fair-Pricing | ZK-Agent-Authorization |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Problem** | "Is this price fair?" | "Is this agent authorized?" |
| **Who benefits** | API buyers (agents) | Agent owners (enterprises) |
| **Trust issue** | Price manipulation | Overspending / policy violations |
| **ZK tech** | zkEngine WASM | JOLT Atlas ONNX |
| **Proof time** | ~5-10s | ~0.7s |
| **Proof size** | ~1-2 KB | 524 bytes |
| **Status** | ✅ **Production-ready** | 📋 Spec complete, ready to build |

## 💰 Business Model Comparison

### **ZK-Fair-Pricing**

**Customers**: x402 API sellers
**Pricing**: $0.001-0.003 per proof
**Target customer LTV**: $100-1,000/month
**Market**: Broad (all x402 APIs)

**Revenue Projection** (Year 1):
- 100 API sellers × $100/mo = **$10K MRR** → **$120K ARR**

### **ZK-Agent-Authorization**

**Customers**: Enterprises with AI agent fleets
**Pricing**: $0.005-0.05 per proof (10x higher!)
**Target customer LTV**: $150-5,000/month
**Market**: Narrow but high-value (enterprise compliance)

**Revenue Projection** (Year 1):
- 50 enterprises × $500/mo = **$25K MRR** → **$300K ARR**

## 🔄 Why Build Both?

### **They Stack!**

**Transaction with both proofs**:

```http
Agent Request:
POST /api/llm
X-PAYMENT: <token>

Server Response (402):
  X-Pricing-Proof: <zkEngine WASM proof>
    ✅ "Price is $0.42 (computed correctly per tariff)"

  X-Auth-Proof: <JOLT Atlas ONNX proof>
    ✅ "Agent is authorized to spend $0.42 per policy"
```

**Value proposition**:
- **Buyer**: "I know the price is fair AND my agent is authorized"
- **Seller**: "I proved fair pricing AND buyer proved authorization"
- **Both**: Complete trust, no disputes, full audit trail

### **Different Customer Segments**

**Fair-Pricing**: Targets **sellers** (API providers)
- Pain: Need to differentiate in x402 Bazaar
- Benefit: "ZK-Verified Pricing" badge → more customers

**Agent-Auth**: Targets **buyers** (enterprises with agents)
- Pain: Compliance, audit trails, agent overspend risk
- Benefit: Cryptographic proof for SOC2/GDPR/SEC

**Result**: Two revenue streams, minimal overlap

## 🚀 Rollout Strategy

### **Phase 1: Fair-Pricing** (✅ Now)
- Already built and production-ready
- Launch to x402 Bazaar sellers
- Prove product-market fit
- Build initial customer base

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-8
**Target**: 10-50 paying API sellers

### **Phase 2: Agent-Authorization** (Next)
- Build on JOLT Atlas foundation
- Target enterprise design partners
- Different sales motion (direct, not marketplace)
- Higher ACV but slower sales cycle

**Timeline**: Weeks 9-16
**Target**: 5-10 enterprise customers

### **Phase 3: Combined Offering** (Future)
- "ZKx402 Trust Suite"
- Bundle both services
- Premium tier: Fair-Pricing + Agent-Auth + white-label
- Target: x402 facilitators (Coinbase, etc.)

**Timeline**: Month 6-12
**Target**: 1-2 facilitator partnerships at $50K-100K/year

## 🎯 Which to Build First?

### **We Already Chose: Fair-Pricing ✅**

**Why it was the right choice**:
1. ✅ Solves x402's core protocol problem (price trust)
2. ✅ Broader market (all x402 APIs vs. just enterprises)
3. ✅ Easier sales (marketplace vs. enterprise deals)
4. ✅ Faster revenue (self-serve vs. 6-month sales cycles)
5. ✅ Proves the ZK value prop

### **Why Agent-Auth is the Perfect #2**

**Builds on Fair-Pricing success**:
1. ✅ Different customer segment (no cannibalization)
2. ✅ Higher revenue per customer (10x pricing)
3. ✅ Proven ZK tech (JOLT Atlas already works)
4. ✅ Complements Fair-Pricing (stack both proofs)
5. ✅ Expands TAM (enterprise market)

**Timeline**: Start building after Fair-Pricing has 10+ customers (Month 3-4)

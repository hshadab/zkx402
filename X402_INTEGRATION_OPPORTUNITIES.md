# zkX402 × Coinbase x402 Integration Opportunities

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Proposal for Integration

---

## Overview

The [Coinbase x402 protocol](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) is an open-source HTTP-native payments standard enabling "1 line of code to accept digital dollars." While x402 handles payment verification and settlement, **there's a significant gap in authorization policy enforcement** that zkX402 can fill with zero-knowledge machine learning.

### The Gap

**Current x402 capabilities:**
- ✅ Payment verification (signature checks)
- ✅ On-chain settlement (ERC-3009)
- ✅ KYT/OFAC screening (Coinbase facilitator)

**Missing capabilities (zkX402 opportunity):**
- ❌ Real-time fraud detection
- ❌ ML-based authorization policies
- ❌ Verifiable authorization proofs (trustless verification)
- ❌ Context-aware payment approval
- ❌ Auditable authorization decisions
- ❌ Agent-specific spending limits with tamper-proof enforcement

---

## Integration Architecture

### 1. zkML-Enhanced Facilitator Server ⭐ **Most Impactful**

**What**: Build a custom x402 facilitator that generates zkML authorization proofs alongside payment verification.

**How it works:**
```
Client → Resource Server → zkML Facilitator → zkX402 Prover
                                   ↓
                            [zkML Proof + Payment Verification]
                                   ↓
                            Resource Server ← Approved/Denied
```

**API Extension:**
```typescript
POST /verify
{
  "paymentPayload": {...},
  "paymentRequirements": {...},
  "authContext": {              // NEW: Authorization context
    "userBalance": 1000,
    "velocity1h": 20,
    "velocity24h": 150,
    "vendorTrust": 85,
    "ipCountry": "US",
    "deviceFingerprint": "..."
  }
}

Response:
{
  "valid": true,
  "zkProof": {                  // NEW: Zero-knowledge authorization proof
    "approved": true,
    "commitment": "0x...",
    "proofData": "...",
    "policyUsed": "neural_auth",
    "verificationTime": "1.2s"
  },
  "onchainData": {...}
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Drop-in replacement for existing x402 facilitators
- ✅ Verifiable authorization (cryptographic proof of correct execution)
- ✅ Trustless verification - don't trust the decision, verify it
- ✅ Works with all x402 SDKs (Go, Java, Python, TypeScript)

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH** - This is the most natural integration point.

---

### 2. Authorization Middleware for Resource Servers

**What**: Express/Fastify/Next.js middleware that sits between x402 payment verification and resource delivery.

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Express.js example
import { x402Middleware } from '@coinbase/x402-server';
import { zkAuthMiddleware } from 'zkx402-middleware';

app.use('/api/premium',
  x402Middleware({
    facilitator: 'https://facilitator.coinbase.com',
    // ... x402 config
  }),
  zkAuthMiddleware({
    proverUrl: 'https://zkx402-agent-auth.onrender.com',
    policyModel: 'neural_auth',
    requireProof: true
  }),
  (req, res) => {
    // Only reached if payment AND zkML authorization succeed
    res.json({ data: premiumContent });
  }
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Minimal code changes for existing x402 integrations
- ✅ Plug-and-play authorization layer
- ✅ Works alongside any facilitator (Coinbase or custom)
- ✅ Backward compatible (optional zkML layer)

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH** - Easy adoption for existing x402 users.

---

### 3. AI Agent Authorization Service

**What**: Specialized service for authorizing AI agent payments with context-aware policies.

**Use Case**: x402's ROADMAP.md mentions AI agents extensively. zkX402 can provide:
- Per-agent spending limits with verifiable zkML proofs
- Velocity-based fraud detection for autonomous agents
- Multi-signature authorization for high-value agent transactions
- Tamper-proof, auditable authorization logs

**How it works:**
```typescript
// AI agent making x402 payment
const payment = await agent.createPayment({
  amount: 50,
  recipient: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  // zkML authorization context
  agentId: 'agent-123',
  dailyBudget: 1000,
  spentToday: 450,
  trustScore: 85
});

// Server verifies with zkX402
const authorized = await zkx402.verifyAgentPayment(payment, {
  model: 'agent_auth_policy',
  requireProof: true
});

if (authorized.zkProof.approved) {
  // Deliver resource to agent
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents runaway AI agent spending
- ✅ Real-time anomaly detection for agent behavior
- ✅ Verifiable authorization (cryptographic proofs)
- ✅ Trustless policy compliance - don't trust, verify

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Timely given x402's AI agent focus.

---

### 4. Policy-as-a-Service Endpoint

**What**: Hosted zkX402 authorization endpoint that any x402 implementation can call.

**API Design:**
```
POST https://auth.zkx402.com/v1/authorize
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>

{
  "paymentData": {
    "amount": 50,
    "sender": "0x...",
    "recipient": "0x..."
  },
  "context": {
    "balance": 1000,
    "velocity1h": 20,
    "velocity24h": 150,
    "merchantTrust": 85
  },
  "policy": "neural_auth" // or "simple_auth", "custom_policy"
}

Response:
{
  "approved": true,
  "zkProof": {
    "commitment": "0x...",
    "proofData": "...",
    "verificationTime": "1.2s"
  },
  "reasoning": "Transaction approved based on velocity and trust score",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-28T10:15:00Z"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No infrastructure needed for x402 users
- ✅ Pay-per-authorization pricing model
- ✅ Managed ONNX model updates
- ✅ SLA guarantees for proof generation

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM** - Complements facilitator approach.

---

### 5. Multi-Party Authorization with zkML

**What**: Enable complex approval workflows using zero-knowledge proofs.

**Use Case**: High-value x402 transactions requiring multiple approvals:
- Corporate spending (manager + finance approval)
- Marketplace escrow (buyer + seller + platform)
- DAO treasury (N-of-M multisig with policy constraints)

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Transaction requires 2-of-3 approval with policy checks
const tx = await x402.createPayment({
  amount: 10000,
  multiSig: {
    required: 2,
    approvers: ['alice', 'bob', 'carol']
  }
});

// Each approver generates zkML proof of their decision
const aliceProof = await zkx402.generateApprovalProof({
  approver: 'alice',
  amount: 10000,
  balance: 50000,
  riskScore: 15,
  policy: 'corporate_approval'
});

// Proofs are aggregated and verified
const authorized = await zkx402.verifyMultiPartyAuth({
  proofs: [aliceProof, bobProof],
  required: 2
});

if (authorized.approved) {
  // Execute x402 payment
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Verifiable (each approver provides cryptographic proof)
- ✅ Trustless multi-party authorization
- ✅ Tamper-proof (can't fake approvals - each proof is independent)
- ✅ Fully auditable approval trail

**Implementation Priority**: **LOW** - Niche use case, but high-value.

---

### 6. x402 Bazaar Integration (Service Discovery)

**What**: Register zkX402 authorization service in x402's planned "Bazaar" discovery layer.

**From x402 ROADMAP.md**:
> "Bazaar expansion with external endpoint registration and A2A agent discovery"

**Integration:**
```json
{
  "service": "zkX402 Authorization",
  "endpoint": "https://auth.zkx402.com",
  "description": "Zero-knowledge ML authorization for x402 payments",
  "capabilities": [
    "fraud-detection",
    "policy-enforcement",
    "agent-authorization",
    "multi-party-approval"
  ],
  "pricing": {
    "model": "pay-per-proof",
    "cost": "0.001 USDC per authorization"
  },
  "sla": {
    "latency": "< 2s",
    "availability": "99.9%"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Discoverable by all x402 ecosystem participants
- ✅ Standardized integration for authorization services
- ✅ Built-in x402 payment for zkX402 usage (meta!)
- ✅ Ecosystem network effects

**Implementation Priority**: **LOW** - Wait for Bazaar launch (Q4 2024).

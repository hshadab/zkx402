# JOLT Atlas Enhancement Usage in Curated Models

Analysis of which JOLT Atlas enhancements are used by the 10 curated authorization models.

## Summary

**Total Enhancements**: 10
**Used by Curated Models**: 7/10 (70%)
**Critical for Curated Models**: 2/10 (Cast, Comparison ops)

## Enhancement Usage Analysis

### ✅ HEAVILY USED (Critical)

#### 1. Cast Operation (Type Conversion)
**Usage**: 10/10 models (100%)
**Status**: CRITICAL - Without this, NO models would work

**Models**:
- ALL 10 models use Cast

**Why Critical**: PyTorch ONNX export automatically inserts Cast operations for type conversions between int32/float during tensor operations. This is unavoidable in standard ONNX export workflows.

**Recommendation**: ✅ Keep - Essential for any PyTorch-generated ONNX model

---

#### 2. Comparison Operations
**Combined Usage**: 10/10 models (100%)

##### Greater (`>`)
**Usage**: 4/10 models (40%)
**Models**:
- simple_threshold.onnx
- multi_factor.onnx
- composite_scoring.onnx
- risk_neural.onnx

**Use Cases**: Balance checks, risk score thresholds

##### Less (`<`)
**Usage**: 1/10 models (10%)
**Models**:
- percentage_limit.onnx

**Use Cases**: Percentage-based limits

##### GreaterOrEqual (`>=`)
**Usage**: 3/10 models (30%)
**Models**:
- age_gate.onnx
- vendor_trust.onnx
- multi_factor.onnx

**Use Cases**: Age verification, trust thresholds

##### LessOrEqual (`<=`)
**Usage**: 4/10 models (40%)
**Models**:
- velocity_1h.onnx
- velocity_24h.onnx
- daily_limit.onnx
- multi_factor.onnx

**Use Cases**: Velocity limits, spending caps

**Recommendation**: ✅ Keep all - Core functionality for authorization logic

---

### ✅ MODERATELY USED

#### 3. Division (Div)
**Usage**: 2/10 models (20%)
**Models**:
- composite_scoring.onnx
- risk_neural.onnx

**Use Cases**:
- Normalization: `(balance - amount) / 1000`
- Scaling: `velocity_1h / 100`
- Weighted scoring: `trust / 2`

**Recommendation**: ✅ Keep - Essential for advanced scoring models

---

#### 4. Clip Operation
**Usage**: 1/10 models (10%)
**Models**:
- risk_neural.onnx

**Use Cases**: Clamping risk scores to 0-100 range

**Recommendation**: ✅ Keep - Useful for bounded outputs, ReLU approximation

---

### ❌ NOT USED (But May Be Valuable)

#### 5. Slice Operation
**Usage**: 0/10 models (0%)
**Current Models**: None use Slice

**Potential Use Cases**:
- Multi-feature extraction: Selecting specific features from input vectors
- Temporal windowing: Extracting time slices from history arrays
- Feature engineering: Isolating subsets of transaction data

**Example Future Model**:
```python
# Transaction history: [amt1, amt2, ..., amt10, vendor1, vendor2, ...]
history = input  # [20 elements]
amounts = Slice(history, start=0, end=10)  # First 10 elements
vendors = Slice(history, start=10, end=20)  # Last 10 elements
```

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Keep - Valuable for future models with multi-dimensional inputs

---

#### 6. Identity Operation
**Usage**: 0/10 models (0%)
**Current Models**: None use Identity

**Potential Use Cases**:
- Model composition: Connecting sub-models
- Residual connections: Skip connections in neural networks
- Debugging: Pass-through for testing

**Example Future Model**:
```python
# Residual authorization model
input_copy = Identity(input)  # Preserve original
transformed = transform(input)
output = Add(input_copy, transformed)  # Residual connection
```

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Keep - Important for advanced model architectures

---

#### 7. MatMult Operation
**Usage**: 0/10 models (0%)
**Current Models**: None use MatMult

**Why Not Used**: Current models are rule-based/lightweight scoring. No dense neural network layers.

**Potential Use Cases**:
- Dense neural networks: Fully-connected layers
- Embedding layers: Feature transformation
- Attention mechanisms: Weighted feature aggregation

**Example Future Model**:
```python
class NeuralAuth(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(5, 10)  # Uses MatMult
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)  # Uses MatMult

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)  # MatMult
        x = ReLU(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)  # MatMult
        return x
```

**Recommendation**: ✅ Keep - Essential for true neural network models. The 1D tensor support fix is particularly valuable.

---

#### 8. MAX_TENSOR_SIZE Increase (64→1024)
**Usage**: 0/10 models need it
**Current Models**: All models use ≤1 element tensors (scalars)

**Why Not Needed**: Current curated models are lightweight with scalar operations.

**When Needed**:
- Neural network weights: 10×10 matrix = 100 elements
- Batch inputs: 32 features = 32 elements
- History vectors: 100 time steps = 100 elements

**Example Future Model Requiring Large Tensors**:
```python
class LargeAuth(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Weight matrix: [18 features, 64 hidden] = 1,152 elements
        # Would FAIL with old 64 limit
        # WORKS with new 1,024 limit
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(18, 64)
```

**Recommendation**: ✅ Keep - Critical for neural network models, transaction history analysis

### 2. Add More Models Using Unused Operations

To fully leverage your enhancements, consider adding:

#### Model 11: Neural Network Scorer
**Would Use**: MatMult, Identity, MAX_TENSOR_SIZE
```python
class NeuralScorer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(5, 32)   # MatMult: 5×32 = 160 params
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(32, 16)  # MatMult: 32×16 = 512 params
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(16, 1)   # MatMult: 16×1 = 16 params

    def forward(self, amount, balance, velocity_1h, velocity_24h, trust):
        x = torch.stack([amount, balance, velocity_1h, velocity_24h, trust])
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))  # MatMult + Clip
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))  # MatMult + Clip
        x = self.fc3(x)          # MatMult
        return (x > 50).int()    # Greater
```

**Total params**: 688 elements (needs MAX_TENSOR_SIZE=1024)

#### Model 12: Transaction History Analyzer
**Would Use**: Slice, MatMult
```python
class HistoryAnalyzer(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, transaction_history):
        # transaction_history: [last_10_amounts, last_10_vendors, current_amount]
        amounts = transaction_history[:10]      # Slice
        vendors = transaction_history[10:20]    # Slice
        current = transaction_history[20]

        # Analyze patterns using weights
        amount_pattern = MatMult(amounts, learned_weights)
        vendor_pattern = MatMult(vendors, trust_matrix)

        risk = amount_pattern + vendor_pattern
        return (risk < threshold).int()
```

#### Model 13: Residual Risk Network
**Would Use**: Identity (residual connections)
```python
class ResidualRiskNet(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        identity = Identity(x)  # Skip connection

        # Transform
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = F.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)

        # Residual connection
        out = Add(out, identity)
        return (out > threshold).int()
```

### 3. Update Documentation

Consider updating TEST_RESULTS.md to include:
- This enhancement usage analysis
- Future model recommendations
- Migration path for users wanting advanced models

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: 7/10 enhancements actively used by curated models
**Impact**: The enhancements enable 100% of curated models to function
**Future Potential**: Unused enhancements (Slice, Identity, MatMult, MAX_TENSOR_SIZE) will be critical for advanced neural network-based authorization models

**Bottom Line**: All enhancements should be kept. The unused ones aren't "wasted effort" - they're infrastructure for more sophisticated future models that go beyond rule-based authorization into learned authorization policies.
